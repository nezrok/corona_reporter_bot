# Corona Watch Bot

The repository of a Telegram bot that that (1) periodically crawls the excel file provided by the
"Sozialministerium Baden Württemberg" for the Corona infection- and death rates in
Baden-Württemberg (BW) and its counties; and (2) periodically sends a report to all subscribed
chats (Telegram uses the term "chats" to describe "users", so we will use this term throughout
this project as well), giving an overview of e.g., today's infection- and death rates in BW and
selected counties, and a comparison to yesterday's rates.
